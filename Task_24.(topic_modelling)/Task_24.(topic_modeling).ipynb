This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\\nIt contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\\nGiven the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.\\nThe dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

       " 'The ultimate Soccer database for data analysis and machine learning\\nWhat you get:\\n+25,000 matches\\n+10,000 players\\n11 European Countries with their lead championship\\nSeasons 2008 to 2016\\nPlayers and Teams\\' attributes* sourced from EA Sports\\' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates\\nTeam line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)\\nBetting odds from up to 10 providers\\nDetailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc...) for +10,000 matches\\n*16th Oct 2016: New table containing teams\\' attributes from FIFA !\\nOriginal Data Source:\\nYou can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier. I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from:\\nhttp://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/ : scores, lineup, team formation and events\\nhttp://www.football-data.co.uk/ : betting odds. Click here to understand the column naming system for betting odds:\\nhttp://sofifa.com/ : players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games. FIFA series and all FIFA assets property of EA Sports.\\nWhen you have a look at the database, you will notice foreign keys for players and matches are the same as the original data sources. I have called those foreign keys \"api_id\".\\nImproving the dataset:\\nYou will notice that some players are missing from the lineup (NULL values). This is because I have not been able to source their attributes from FIFA. This will be fixed overtime as the crawling algorithm is being improved. The dataset will also be expanded to include international games, national cups, Champion\\'s League and Europa League. Please ask me if you\\'re after a specific tournament.\\nPlease get in touch with me if you want to help improve this dataset.\\nCLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE PROJECT GITHUB\\nImportant note for people interested in using the crawlers: since I first wrote the crawling scripts (in python), it appears sofifa.com has changed its design and with it comes new requirements for the scripts. The existing script to crawl players (\\'Player Spider\\') will not work until i\\'ve updated it.\\nExploring the data:\\nNow that\\'s the fun part, there is a lot you can do with this dataset. I will be adding visuals and insights to this overview page but please have a look at the kernels and give it a try yourself ! Here are some ideas for you:\\nThe Holy Grail... ... is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I\\'ve achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game, you\\'ve got to know that the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision.\\nProbabilities vs Odds\\nWhen running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions.\\nExplore and visualize features\\nWith access to players and teams attributes, team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights into The Beautiful Game . Who knows, Guardiola himself may hire one of you some day!',\n",
       " \"Background\\nWhat can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?\\nThis is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.\\nData Source Transfer Summary\\nWe (Kaggle) have removed the original version of this dataset per a DMCA takedown request from IMDB. In order to minimize the impact, we're replacing it with a similar set of films and data fields from The Movie Database (TMDb) in accordance with their terms of use. The bad news is that kernels built on the old dataset will most likely no longer work.\\nThe good news is that:\\nYou can port your existing kernels over with a bit of editing. This kernel offers functions and examples for doing so. You can also find a general introduction to the new format here.\\nThe new dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew, rather than just the first three actors.\\nActor and actresses are now listed in the order they appear in the credits. It's unclear what ordering the original dataset used; for the movies I spot checked it didn't line up with either the credits order or IMDB's stars order.\\nThe revenues appear to be more current. For example, IMDB's figures for Avatar seem to be from 2010 and understate the film's global revenues by over $2 billion.\\nSome of the movies that we weren't able to port over (a couple of hundred) were just bad entries. For example, this IMDB entry has basically no accurate information at all. It lists Star Wars Episode VII as a documentary.\\nData Source Transfer Details\\nSeveral of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions from this kernel.\\nEven in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example, previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version.\\nThere's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew.\\nAll fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords, genres, ratings, or the like.\\nYour existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run.\\nIf you are curious about how this dataset was prepared, the code to access TMDb's API is posted here.\\nNew columns:\\nhomepage\\nid\\noriginal_title\\noverview\\npopularity\\nproduction_companies\\nproduction_countries\\nrelease_date\\nspoken_languages\\nstatus\\ntagline\\nvote_average\\nLost columns:\\nactor_1_facebook_likes\\nactor_2_facebook_likes\\nactor_3_facebook_likes\\naspect_ratio\\ncast_total_facebook_likes\\ncolor\\ncontent_rating\\ndirector_facebook_likes\\nfacenumber_in_poster\\nmovie_facebook_likes\\nmovie_imdb_link\\nnum_critic_for_reviews\\nnum_user_for_reviews\\nOpen Questions About the Data\\nThere are some things we haven't had a chance to confirm about the new dataset. If you have any insights, please let us know in the forums!\\nAre the budgets and revenues all in US dollars? Do they consistently show the global revenues?\\nThis dataset hasn't yet gone through a data quality analysis. Can you find any obvious corrections? For example, in the IMDb version it was necessary to treat values of zero in the budget field as missing. Similar findings would be very helpful to your fellow Kagglers! (It's probably a good idea to keep treating zeros as missing, with the caveat that missing budgets much more likely to have been from small budget films in the first place).\\nInspiration\\nCan you categorize the films by type, such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this, but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles.\\nHow sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on?\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis dataset was generated from The Movie Database API.

       " 'Context\\nBitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus \"chained\" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred. As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. Included here is historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for select bitcoin exchanges where trading takes place.

       " 'Context\\nFor the first time, Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey received over 16,000 responses and we learned a ton about who is working with data, what’s happening at the cutting edge of machine learning across industries, and how new data scientists can best break into the field.\\nTo share some of the initial insights from the survey, we’ve worked with the folks from The Pudding to put together this interactive report. They’ve shared all of the kernels used in the report here.\\nContent\\nThe data includes 5 files:\\nschema.csv: a CSV file with survey schema. This schema includes the questions that correspond to each column name in both the multipleChoiceResponses.csv and freeformResponses.csv.\\nmultipleChoiceResponses.csv: Respondents\\' answers to multiple choice and ranking questions. These are non-randomized and thus a single row does correspond to all of a single user\\'s answers. -freeformResponses.csv: Respondents\\' freeform answers to Kaggle\\'s survey questions. These responses are randomized within a column, so that reading across a single row does not give a single user\\'s answers.\\nconversionRates.csv: Currency conversion rates (to USD) as accessed from the R package \"quantmod\" on September 14, 2017\\nRespondentTypeREADME.txt: This is a schema for decoding the responses in the \"Asked\" column of the schema.csv file.\\nKernel Awards in November\\nIn the month of November, we’re awarding $1000 a week for code and analyses shared on this dataset via Kaggle Kernels. Read more about this month’s Kaggle Kernels Awards and help us advance the state of machine learning and data science by exploring this one of a kind dataset.\\nMethodology\\nThis survey received 16,716 usable respondents from 171 countries and territories. If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, we grouped them into a group named “Other” for anonymity.\\nWe excluded respondents who were flagged by our survey system as “Spam” or who did not answer the question regarding their employment status (this question was the first required question, so not answering it indicates that the respondent did not proceed past the 5th question in our survey).\\nMost of our respondents were found primarily through Kaggle channels, like our email list, discussion forums and social media channels.\\nThe survey was live from August 7th to August 25th. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was 16.4 minutes. We allowed respondents to complete the survey at any time during that window.\\nWe received salary data by first asking respondents for their day-to-day currency, and then asking them to write in either their total compensation.\\nWe’ve provided a csv with an exchange rate to USD for you to calculate the salary in US dollars on your own.\\nThe question was optional\\nNot every question was shown to every respondent. In an attempt to ask relevant questions to each respondent, we generally asked work related questions to employed data scientists and learning related questions to students. There is a column in the schema.csv file called \"Asked\" that describes who saw each question. You can learn more about the different segments we used in the schema.csv file and RespondentTypeREADME.txt in the data tab.\\nTo protect the respondents’ identity, the answers to multiple choice questions have been separated into a separate data file from the open-ended responses. We do not provide a key to match up the multiple choice and free form responses. Further, the free form responses have been randomized column-wise such that the responses that appear on the same row did not necessarily come from the same survey-taker.',\n",

Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\\nGiven the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).
